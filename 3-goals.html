  <title>Zero Harm - The 3 Goals</title>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="container">
    <h2>What are the 3 goals?</h2>
    <p>Throughout this website you will see frequent mention of <strong>"the 3 goals"</strong>. Below I provide more explanation detailing exactly what those goals are and why they are each a priority. I also provide links to other resources that offer help in pursuing these goals.</p>

    <ol>
      <li class="important">0 Waste Packaging</li>
      <p>
      Products that meet this goal are products whose packaging meet the following standards, either in entirety or piece by piece:
        <ul>
          <li>compostoble</li>
          <li>recyclable</li>
          <li>reusable</li>
        </ul>
        In essence, the 0 Waste Packaging goal looks primarily at the final stage of a <strong>product's life cycle</strong>, <em>disposal</em>, to determine if this is a sustainable product.
      </p>
      <li class="important">0 Harm Manufacturing</li>
      <p>
        The purchase and use of a product is only one stage in its life cycle. Before it was packaged and put on a shelf, the materials for both the product and its packaging were sourced and then manufactured. 0 Harm looks into the <em>material and manufacturing</em> stage of each product to determine wether or not the process of bringing this product to consumers is just as sustainable as the end of its life cycle.
      </p>
      <li class="important">0 Harm User Experience</li>
      <p>
        Plenty of products are regulated to ensure they are not damaging to the environment or the consumer specifically when they are used. And plenty of products are not. For instance, surprisingly (in the US specifically) one such category of products that remains unregulated is <strong>cosmetics</strong>. <a href="https://www.storyofstuff.org/movies/story-of-cosmetics/">The Story of Stuff</a> and the <a href="https://www.safecosmetics.org/">Campaign for Safe Cosmetics</a> has made incredible progress in raising awareness of this issue and pursuing regulation and resources to ensure future consumers are not poisoning themselves with their chosen cosmetics. <a href="https://www.ewg.org/">EWG</a> is now an excellent resource for vetting various products based on their ingriedients. Depending on the country you reside in, there may be other variations or gaps in standards and regulation on the products you use.
      </p>
    </ol>
    <p>
      You may have noticed a few different stages of a the product lifecycle mentioned above. Here's a simple example of what the complete lifecycle of a product might look like.
    </p>

    <p>
      Generally speaking the purpose of 0 Harm is to consider each product integrated into our lifestyles within their entire respective product lifecycle. If we see evidence that a product is <span class="important">sustainable at every stage of its lifecycle</span>, then our conclusion is that this is at least a product worth trying and a brand worth amplifying.
    </p>

    <h2 class="important">The Fourth Goal</h2>
    <p>
      We should note there is also a fourth "stretch goal" of 0 Harm and that is <strong>0 Harm Manufacturer Experience</strong>.
      0 Harm may never have the resources to adequately vet products based on our first 3 Goals. If that day comes, we would love to further vet our products based on the quality of life of the workers who source the materials and manufacture the goods and packaging. Because every step of the materials and manufacturing process often touches <span class="important">multiple companies and multiple workforces</span>, this is a lofty goal. But we think that in order for a product to truly be sustainable on all levels, the company should also meet high standards for their workforce's quality of life. These standards include, but are not limited to:
        <ul>
          <li>adequate pay for all workers to not merely sustain, but thrive</li>
          <li>safe working conditions</li>
          <li>reasonable work hours that allow all workers a balanced, healthy lifestyle</li>
        </ul>
      After all, what good is sustaining the planet we're all living on, if we never get to stop and smell the roses we saved?
